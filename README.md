# Flashcards API

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## About this project

This is the API for the flashcards application located at this other [repository](https://github.com/gabrielnakaema/flashcards-front)

This is still a work in progress

This project's goal is to create an application where users can create and store decks of flashcards that can assist them in learning through spaced repetition methods.

At the moment, users can create decks and add cards to it and study from decks created by other people, API endpoints can be located down [below](#api-endpoints).

### Technologies used

- Java 11
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Lombok
- PostgreSQL

## Planned features

- Allow users to set created decks to private and public
- Add record of last accessed cards by a user so the next time they can get different cards
- Add possibility to prioritize cards or not, so they can come first or last
- Allow users to save copies of someone else's decks

JWT token is obtained by signing up and then logging in with the correct credentials.
